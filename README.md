Ilyas Et‑Thabity

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I’m Ilyas Et‑Thabity, a student at the University Chouaib Doukkali (UCD) in El Jadida, Morocco. I’m passionate about applied computer science and cyber security, and I lead UCD‑CYBERFORCE, a student club focused on hacking, forensics and networking. When I’m not studying algorithms or dissecting packets, you’ll find me tinkering with Linux, writing C and Python, and building tools for our club.

🚀 Mission & Focus

Empower learning through code: I love turning theory into practice. Whether it’s a simple C program or a complex network scanner, I build to learn and to teach.

Grow the cyber community: As founder of UCD‑CYBERFORCE, I organize workshops, CTFs and study groups to share knowledge and cultivate our local cyber culture.

Explore the unknown: From low‑level programming to network protocols, I’m always curious and eager to dive deeper into new technologies.

🧰 Skills & Tools

Languages: C, Python, Bash

Operating systems: Linux (Parrot OS, Ubuntu), Windows when necessary

Dev & tools: Git, GitHub,

Core concepts: Algorithms & data structures, networking fundamentals, cyber security basics, Linux administration
